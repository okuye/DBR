## To Do List
Concurrency and Atomicity: 
Consider using ZIO's STM (Software Transactional Memory) for atomic state management when moving to a database or 
persistent storage.

Validation and Error Handling: Ensure comprehensive validation of transaction requests to prevent processing invalid or 
malicious data. Additionally, consistent and meaningful error responses will improve the API's usability and debuggability.

Persistence: For a production application, 
integrating with a persistent storage system (e.g., relational database, NoSQL database) 
would be necessary to maintain state across application restarts and ensure data durability.

Security: Implement security measures, such as authentication and authorization, to protect sensitive endpoints and data.
Ensure secure handling of user data and transactions.

Testing: Expanding the test coverage to include scenarios for concurrent transactions, edge cases in balance calculations, 
and error handling would strengthen the application's reliability.

Documentation and API Design: Comprehensive documentation, including API endpoints, request/response schemas, 
and error codes, will be beneficial for both development and usage of the application.
